Round
your
city
round
the
clock
Everybody
needs
you
No
you
can't
make
everybody
equal
Although
you
got
beaucoup
family
You
don't
even
got
nobody
bein'
honest
with
you
Breathe
'til
I
evaporated
My
whole
body
see
through
Transportation
handmade
(G)
And
I
know
it
better
than
most
people
I
don't
trust
'em
anyways
You
can't
break
the
law
with
them
Get
some
gushy
have
a
calm
night
Shooters
killin'
left
and
right
Workin'
through
your
worst
night
If
I
get
my
money
right
You
know
I
won't
need
you
And
I
tell
you
I
hope
the
sack
is
full
